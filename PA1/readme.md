## How to run

1. Inside serialize.py, update the path to your flatbuffers python module. It will be located wherever you built flatbuffers. By default, it will be assumed to be in `/home/user/Apps/flatbuffers/python`.
2. In a separate terminal, start the grocery server with `python3 grocery_server.py`.
3. In a separate terminal, start the health server with `python3 health_server.py`.
4. In a separate terminal, start the fridge client with `python3 main.py`.
